## Introduction
<p id="description">

Welcome to the Pose Estimation Project! This project focuses on analyzing and estimating human poses from images or videos. Using cutting-edge computer vision techniques, this repository provides tools and models to accurately detect and estimate key points of the human body.

## What is Pose Estimation?
Pose estimation involves detecting and localizing key points on a person's body, such as joints and limbs. This project utilizes advanced algorithms to precisely identify these keypoints, enabling applications in various domains including fitness tracking, gesture recognition, augmented reality, and more.

## Project Goals
Robust Estimation Models: Implement state-of-the-art algorithms to accurately estimate human poses under different conditions and environments.
Ease of Integration: Provide easy-to-use APIs and examples for integrating pose estimation capabilities into applications and workflows.
Documentation: Offer comprehensive documentation to guide users in understanding, implementing, and extending the functionality of the provided models.</p>
