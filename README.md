## Introduction
<p id="description">I intend to build a real-time object classification system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) a cutting-edge object detection and classification technique. The project will involve the development of a robust and efficient system capable of identifying and classifying objects in real-time pictures and video streams making it appropriate for a wide range of applications such as surveillance autonomous cars and others. It can be used to classify objects in Images, Videos and Webcam</p>

## Requirements
The Entire project is worked in the pycharm environment. Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pycharm
- OpenCV
- YOLO Pre-trained Weights and Configurations (download from YOLO website)
- Custom Dataset (if you want to train a custom YOLO model)
- GPU (for high quality results)

Required Dependencies such as : 
* opencv-Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* cvzone
* matplotlib
* ultralytics

## Customization
The steps below can be used to adapt the YOLO model for particular object classes:

- A dataset of your object classes with labeled annotations should be gathered.

- Utilizing your dataset, create a unique YOLO model. The YOLO training script and setups are available for usage.

- Update the project configuration after adding your customized YOLO model weights and configurations to the proper location.

## Performance
The system has been optimized for real-time performance, particularly when a GPU is used. However, actual performance may vary depending on your system configuration and the task's complexity. To attain the greatest results, consider fine-tuning the system for your individual use case.
